## Maintenance guidelines

### What belongs here

- Rules learned from **real bugs** (not hypothetical ones)
- Policies where violating them causes **hard-to-find state inconsistencies**
- Ownership contracts between classes/modules that aren't obvious from the code
- Decisions that were **consciously chosen** over a simpler alternative

> Do NOT add: general best practices, things already obvious from the code,
> or temporary notes about in-progress work (use a task/plan for those).

### When to update

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| A bug was caused by violating an implicit rule | Add the rule here |
| A new ADR establishes a coding contract | Summarize the contract here, link the ADR |
| An existing rule turns out to be wrong or too narrow | Update or remove it |
| A rule is already enforced by the code itself (e.g. type system) | Remove it — code is the source of truth |

### How to update

1. Add/edit the relevant section below using the **Principle + Concrete Rule** format.
2. Commit together with the code change that motivated it.
3. If the rule is substantial, create an ADR first and link it here.

## 1. Architecture & State Management

### Mode Transition Flow (ADR-008)

- **Principle**: State transitions must flow through a single source of truth to ensure thorough cleanup of the previous state and proper initialization of the next.
- **Concrete Rule**: `AppController.setMode(mode)` is the single entry point. Before calling `_switchActiveObject()`, always call `setMode('object')` first if `_selectionMode === 'edit'`. This guarantees in-progress operations are canceled and visual states (`setFaceHighlight(null)`, `clearExtrusionDisplay()`, `clearSketchRect()`) are cleared before the active object is swapped.

```js
// Correct pattern when switching active objects from any mode
if (this._selectionMode === 'edit') this.setMode('object')
// ... then _switchActiveObject(newId, true)
```

`setMode()` guarantees, in order:
1. Cancel in-progress operations (grab, rotate, face drag, object drag)
2. Clear active object visual state
3. Reset controller state (`_hoveredFace`, `_faceDragging`, `_dragFace`, `_cleanupEditSubstate()`)
4. Dispatch to new mode — `instanceof Sketch` → Edit 2D, otherwise → Edit 3D

### State Restoration on Mode Exit

- **Principle**: Temporary state changes made by a specific mode must be explicitly reverted when exiting that mode to prevent UI desync.
- **Concrete Rule**: `_objSelected` is set to `false` when entering Edit Mode. When returning to Object mode via `setMode('object')`, if `_activeObj` exists, you must manually restore `_objSelected = true` and call `meshView.setObjectSelected(true)`. Without this, the mobile toolbar's Edit and Delete buttons stay disabled.

```js
if (this._activeObj && !this._objSelected) {
  this._objSelected = true
  this._activeObj.meshView.setObjectSelected(true)
}
```

### Entity Capability Contracts (ADR-012, Phase 5-3)

- **Principle**: Determine available operations by the entity's class type, not a scalar property (like `dimension`). Immutable operations should return new instances and swap them in the model rather than mutating the original.
- **Concrete Rule**: `instanceof Sketch` = 2D unextruded; `instanceof Cuboid` = 3D. `Sketch.extrude(height)` does **not** mutate the Sketch — it returns a new `Cuboid` reusing the same `id`, `name`, and `meshView`. Call `SceneService.extrudeSketch(id, height)` to perform the swap in `SceneModel`.

  - `extrudeFace` signature: `(face: Face, savedFaceCorners, normal, dist)` — callers pass a `Face` object (`_dragFace`), not an index. `Face.index` is used where an index is still needed (e.g. `MeshView.setFaceHighlight`).
  - `Cuboid` must always have: `move()`, `extrudeFace(face, ...)`, `faces: Face[6]`, `edges: Edge[12]`.
  - `Sketch` only needs: `extrude(height)`, `rename(name)`, `sketchRect`.
  - `MeasureLine` holds two `THREE.Vector3` endpoints (`p1`, `p2`) and a `MeasureLineView`. It has no `vertices`/`edges`/`faces` graph and must be excluded from `collectSnapTargets` loops and `_hitAnyObject` raycasting (guard with `instanceof MeasureLine`). Edit Mode is blocked; **Grab (move) is allowed** — `corners` returns `[p1, p2]` and `move(startCorners, delta)` translates both endpoints. `MeasureLineView.updateGeometry([p1, p2])` calls `update(p1, p2)` to refresh the line and label. Pointer drag is not available (no `cuboid` raycasting surface); use G key.
  - `ImportedMesh` has a synthetic 8-corner AABB (`_corners8`, initialised from geometry bounding box by `SceneService` after `updateGeometryBuffers`). **Grab and pointer drag are allowed** — `move(startCorners, delta)` updates `_corners8`; `ImportedMeshView.updateGeometry(corners)` computes the centroid and sets `cuboid.position = centroid − originalCenter`. Edit Mode is blocked.
  - `CoordinateFrame` is a named reference frame child of any geometry object or another `CoordinateFrame` (ADR-018 Phase A, ADR-019 Phase B). It has no vertex/edge/face graph and no raycasting surface (`cuboid = null`). **Grab (G key) and Rotate (R key) are allowed.** `corners` returns `[this._worldPos]`; `move(startCorners, delta)` updates `_worldPos`; `CoordinateFrameView.updateRotation(quaternion)` applies the quaternion to the root `THREE.Group`. The animation loop processes frames in **topological order** (shallow before deep) so nested frame chains propagate in a single pass. `_rotate.startRot` saves the quaternion on R-key press; cancel restores it. Edit Mode, pointer drag, Ctrl+drag rotation, pivot selection, and stack mode remain blocked. `CoordinateFrameView` implements the full `MeshView` no-op interface (including `updateBoxHelper`). Deletion of a parent cascades recursively (`SceneService.deleteObject` calls itself for each child, `OutlinerView.removeObject` also recurses).
  - Ctrl+drag rotation and pivot selection (`_startPivotSelect`) are blocked for `ImportedMesh`, `MeasureLine`, and `CoordinateFrame` (no local vertex geometry to rotate/pivot).
  - The "no Edit Mode" guard applies to `setMode('edit')` for `ImportedMesh`, `MeasureLine`, and `CoordinateFrame`.

### MeasureLineView No-Op Interface Completeness

- **Principle**: Every method called via `_meshView` in `AppController` must exist on `MeasureLineView` (as a no-op if not applicable), or any code path that reaches it when a `MeasureLine` is active will throw `TypeError` and silently abort the handler.
- **Concrete Rule**: Whenever a new method is added to `MeshView` and called through `_meshView` in `AppController`, add the same method as a no-op `(){}` to `MeasureLineView`. The current required no-op list: `setFaceHighlight`, `clearExtrusionDisplay`, `clearSketchRect`, `clearVertexHover`, `clearEdgeHover`, `clearEditSelection`, `clearPivotDisplay`, `clearSnapDisplay`, `showSnapCandidates`, `showSnapLocked`, `clearSnapLocked`. Missing `showSnapCandidates`/`showSnapLocked`/`clearSnapLocked` caused a `TypeError` in `_onPointerMove` that prevented the preview guide from rendering on the second (and any subsequent) measure placement.

### Measure Snap Display Must Not Depend on Active MeshView

- **Principle**: Snap candidate display relies on `THREE.Points` objects owned by a specific `MeshView` instance. If the active object is a `MeasureLine`, `_meshView` returns `MeasureLineView` which has no such infrastructure — calling snap display methods on it is a no-op, so candidates are invisible.
- **Concrete Rule**: `_measure.snapMeshView` is set in `_startMeasurePlacement()` to a real `MeshView` (falls back to any non-`MeasureLine` object's view when the active object is a `MeasureLine`). All snap display calls during measure placement use `_measure.snapMeshView`, not `_meshView`. Clear `_measure.snapMeshView` (and call `clearSnapDisplay()` on it) in both `_cancelMeasure()` and `_confirmMeasurePoint()` Phase 2.

```js
// _startMeasurePlacement()
const activeObj = this._scene.activeObject
const _isSnapCapable = o => !(o instanceof MeasureLine) && !(o instanceof CoordinateFrame)
this._measure.snapMeshView = (activeObj && _isSnapCapable(activeObj))
  ? activeObj.meshView
  : ([...this._scene.objects.values()].find(_isSnapCapable)?.meshView ?? null)

// cleanup in _cancelMeasure() / _confirmMeasurePoint() Phase 2
this._measure.snapMeshView?.clearSnapDisplay()
this._measure.snapMeshView = null
```

### MeasureLineView Label Lifecycle

- **Principle**: HTML labels that overlay a Three.js canvas must be repositioned every animation frame because the camera may have moved.
- **Concrete Rule**: `MeasureLineView.updateLabelPosition()` must be called once per frame from the animation loop for every `MeasureLine` in the scene. The label uses `position: fixed` and is projected from world-space midpoint via `Vector3.project(camera)`. It is appended to `document.body` and removed in `dispose()`.

### CoordinateFrame Depth Rendering and Visibility Policy

- **Principle**: Gizmo-style objects (axes, labels) cause visual noise when always visible, and are buried inside parent geometry when idle. Frames should only appear when the user is actively working with them.
- **Concrete Rule — parent-gated visibility**: `CoordinateFrameView` is `visible = false` by default. `setParentSelected(true)` is called by `AppController._setChildFramesVisible()` whenever the parent object is selected; `setParentSelected(false)` hides it when the parent is deselected. `setParentSelected(true)` also applies X-ray (`depthTest: false`, `renderOrder: 1`) so the frame is always visible through the parent geometry.
- **Concrete Rule — self-selection highlight**: `setObjectSelected(selected)` ONLY changes the origin sphere color (gold `#ffcc00` + scale 1.6× when selected, white + 1.0× when not). It does NOT change `visible` or `depthTest` — those are managed by `showFull`/`showDimmed`/`hide`.
- **Visibility ownership table** (CoordinateFrame-specific):

| Trigger | Method | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Geometry parent selected | `showFull()` | visible + full opacity + X-ray |
| Frame selected (active frame in tree) | `showFull()` + `setObjectSelected(true)` | visible + full opacity + X-ray + gold sphere |
| Non-selected frame in same tree | `showDimmed()` | visible + 0.30 opacity + X-ray (de-emphasised) |
| Frame/geometry deselected | `hide()` | `visible = false` |
| Outliner eye icon | `setVisible(bool)` | `visible` on/off |
| Connection line (child → parent frame) | `showConnection(dimmed)` / `hideConnection()` | dashed line between frame origins |

- **Frame tree visibility entry points** in `AppController`:
  - `_showGeometryFrameTree(geoId)` — called when a geometry object is selected. Collects ALL descendant CoordinateFrames via `_collectAllDescendantFrames`, calls `showFull()` on each, shows connection lines at full opacity. Stores IDs in `_activeFrameChain`.
  - `_showFrameChain(frameId)` — called when a CoordinateFrame is selected. Walks up to find the geometry root, then shows the entire frame tree: selected frame via `showFull()` (full opacity + gold sphere), all others via `showDimmed()` (0.30 opacity). Connection line to the selected frame is full opacity; all others are dimmed.
  - `_hideFrameChain()` — hides all frames in `_activeFrameChain` via `hide()` + `hideConnection()`. Called on deselect, switch, edit-mode entry.
  - `_setChildFramesVisible(parentId, visible)` — thin wrapper: `true` → `_showGeometryFrameTree`, `false` → `_hideFrameChain`.
- **No selection ring**: the orange wireframe selection sphere was removed. Selection state is conveyed solely by the depth override (arrows pop to the front when selected).
- **Axis label sprites** (`_labelX/Y/Z`): `THREE.Sprite` with `CanvasTexture` bearing the letter in the axis colour. Positioned at `AXIS_LENGTH + 0.09` along each axis so the letter sits just past the arrowhead. Must be included in the `depthTest`/`renderOrder` loop and their `material.map` must be disposed in `dispose()`.

### Auto Origin Frame on 3D Object Creation

- **Principle**: Every 3D geometry object should have a visible origin coordinate frame so the user can immediately read its reference direction.
- **Concrete Rule**: `SceneService.createCuboid()`, `SceneService.extrudeSketch()`, and `SceneService.duplicateCuboid()` each call `this.createCoordinateFrame(id, 'Origin')` after registering the new `Cuboid` in the model. The frame is named `'Origin'` (fixed string) to distinguish it from manually-added frames (named `'Frame.XXX'`). `createCoordinateFrame` accepts an optional second parameter `overrideName` for this purpose. Sketches do NOT get an origin frame (they are 2D and have no meaningful reference direction until extruded).

### CommandStack: push() vs execute() — Post-Hoc Recording

- **Principle**: `CommandStack.execute(cmd)` calls `cmd.execute()` then pushes to the undo stack. Using it for a just-completed operation double-applies the effect.
- **Concrete Rule**: All `_confirm*()` handlers (Grab, FaceExtrude, Rotate, ExtrudePhase) and mutation helpers (`_deleteObject`, `_addObject`, `_renameObject`) complete the operation first via their own logic, then call `_commandStack.push(cmd)` to record it — **never** `_commandStack.execute(cmd)`. Use `execute()` only when the command is the single driver of the mutation (currently unused; reserved for future composite operations).

### Entity Swap Methods Must Emit Domain Events

- **Principle**: Any SceneService method that swaps one entity for another in `SceneModel` without going through `deleteObject`/`createXxx` bypasses event emission. Subscribers (OutlinerView, AppController) see stale state: the old entity's type icon persists, the new entity is invisible in the Outliner.
- **Concrete Rule**: Every method that calls `this._model.removeObject(id)` or `this._model.addObject(entity)` directly **must** also emit `this.emit('objectRemoved', id)` / `this.emit('objectAdded', entity)`. Currently affected: `extrudeProfile()` (fixed 2026-03-27), `detachObject()`, `reattachObject()`. New swap methods must follow the same pattern.

### Soft-Delete Pattern for Undo-Capable Deletion

- **Principle**: `SceneService.deleteObject()` calls `meshView.dispose()`, which destroys GPU resources and removes objects from the Three.js scene. Once disposed, a meshView cannot be restored without full reconstruction — making undo of delete impossible.
- **Concrete Rule**: `AppController._deleteObject()` uses `SceneService.detachObject()` (removes from SceneModel, clears worldPoseCache, emits `objectRemoved`, does NOT dispose) + `meshView.setVisible(false)`. The Three.js objects remain in the scene graph but invisible. `SceneService.deleteObject()` (dispose path) is now only called in two cases: (1) cascade-delete of child frames inside a `deleteObject` call itself; (2) `_clearScene()` which destroys everything. The `CommandStack.MAX=50` limit bounds the number of live-but-invisible meshViews to an acceptable constant.

### N Panel Read-Only Rows Must Render the Passed Value

- **Principle**: A display-layer function that ignores its data arguments and renders a hardcoded constant is a silent data-loss bug: the controller passes correct values but the UI always shows wrong ones.
- **Concrete Rule**: In `UIView.updateNPanelForFrame`, the `locked` branch of `locRow` and `rotRow` must pass the `val` argument through to `row()`, not substitute `0`. Example: `(ax, col, val) => row(ax, col, val)`, NOT `(ax, col, _v) => row(ax, col, 0)`. The Origin frame shows world position (non-zero) in the locked Location row; always derive displayed values from what the caller passes.

### Euler Angle Convention for CoordinateFrame (ADR-020)

- **Principle**: The project adopts ROS REP-103 conventions throughout. The world frame uses ROS axes (+X forward, +Y left, +Z up). Euler angle display for `CoordinateFrame` must use the same convention — **intrinsic ZYX = extrinsic XYZ = RPY** — not the Three.js default `'XYZ'` order.
- **Concrete Rule**: All `setFromQuaternion` / `Euler` calls for `CoordinateFrame` rotation display must use order `'ZYX'` (Three.js), which corresponds to intrinsic ZYX = extrinsic XYZ = ROS RPY. Using `'XYZ'` is wrong: it is intrinsic XYZ = extrinsic ZYX, and produces incorrect angle values.

```js
// WRONG — intrinsic XYZ, not ROS RPY
const euler = new THREE.Euler().setFromQuaternion(q, 'XYZ')

// CORRECT — intrinsic ZYX = extrinsic XYZ = ROS RPY
const euler = new THREE.Euler().setFromQuaternion(q, 'ZYX')
```

Affected sites: `CoordinateFrame.js` JSDoc, `AppController.js` (two `setFromQuaternion` calls), `UIView.js` N-panel label (show "RPY" not "XYZ").

### Mouse-Driven Rotation Angle Sign Convention

- **Principle**: The direction mapping from screen-space cursor angle to 3D rotation must match user expectation: moving the cursor clockwise around the frame should rotate the frame in a visually consistent direction.
- **Concrete Rule**: In `_applyRotate()`, use `angle = this._rotate.startAngle - currentAngle` (NOT `currentAngle - startAngle`). The `atan2`-based `currentAngle` increases when the cursor moves CCW on screen; subtracting from `startAngle` inverts this so the physical rotation tracks the cursor correctly. This affects only the mouse-driven path; numeric input (`this._rotate.hasInput`) uses the parsed degree value directly and is unaffected.

```js
// WRONG — rotation appears reversed on screen
angle = currentAngle - this._rotate.startAngle

// CORRECT
angle = this._rotate.startAngle - currentAngle
```

### Visual State Ownership

- **Principle**: Each visual flag must have exactly one mutator function to prevent race conditions and scattered state updates.
- **Concrete Rule**: Never set `visible` flags in `MeshView` outside their designated owners:

| Element | Owner |
|---------|-------|
| `hlMesh.visible` | `setFaceHighlight()` |
| `cuboid.visible` / `wireframe.visible` | `setVisible()` |
| `boxHelper.visible` | `setObjectSelected()` |

---

## 2. Events & Interaction (Touch/Pointer)

### Touch vs. Pointer Event Asymmetry

- **Principle**: Do not rely on `pointermove` firing before `pointerdown` for hover states or hit-testing, as touch devices combine these into a single tap interaction.
- **Concrete Rule**: In `_onPointerDown`, you must manually re-run hit tests (e.g. `_hitFace()`) before calling `_handleEditClick`. Otherwise, touch taps will never successfully select sub-elements like faces or vertices.

```js
// Required pattern at the bottom of _onPointerDown (edit mode path)
if (this._scene.editSubstate === '3d') {
  if (this._editSelectMode === 'face') {
    const hit = this._hitFace()
    this._hoveredFace = hit?.face ?? null
    this._meshView.setFaceHighlight(this._hoveredFace?.index ?? null, this._corners)
  } // likewise for vertex / edge
}
this._handleEditClick(e.shiftKey)
```

### Gesture-Based Interaction Priority (Mobile)

- **Principle**: Mobile interactions should prioritize combined gesture flows (tap + drag) over multi-step button clicks for primary spatial actions.
- **Concrete Rule**: On mobile (`innerWidth < 768`), tapping a face in Edit 3D auto-starts extrude. In `_onPointerDown`, after `_handleEditClick`, call `_startFaceExtrude(face)` and set `_activeDragPointerId`. The auto-start fires only when: `editSubstate === '3d'`, `_editSelectMode === 'face'`, `!e.shiftKey`, and at least one Face is in `editSelection` after the click. Face extrude is a gesture-only operation — there is no Extrude toolbar button in Edit 3D.

### Interaction Confirmation Lifecycle

- **Principle**: Continuous drag interactions must lock in their final value on release (`pointerup`), not on initial touch (`pointerdown`), to correctly capture the movement delta.
- **Concrete Rule**: `_confirmFaceExtrude()` belongs in `_onPointerUp`. Only confirm if `_activeDragPointerId === e.pointerId` (meaning a canvas drag actually occurred). This prevents double-confirms when the user taps toolbar buttons. Do **not** move confirm back to `_onPointerDown`.

```js
const wasDragging = this._activeDragPointerId === e.pointerId
if (wasDragging) this._activeDragPointerId = null
if (this._faceExtrude.active && wasDragging) { this._confirmFaceExtrude(); return }
```

### Global Event vs. UI Event Delegation

- **Principle**: Global `window` listeners must explicitly ignore pointer events originating from UI overlays to avoid intercepting and canceling clicks meant for buttons.
- **Concrete Rule**: In `_onPointerDown`, immediately check `if (e.target !== this._sceneView.renderer.domElement) return` before processing grabs or extrudes. This guard goes **before** the grab/faceExtrude active checks so that toolbar button taps fall through to their own `click` listeners. Without this, `_handleEditClick` fires on every toolbar tap and clears face/vertex/edge selection before the button's `click` handler runs.

```js
if (e.target !== this._sceneView.renderer.domElement) return
```

### Input Method Mutually Exclusive States

- **Principle**: Only disable global camera controls when a specific operation fully consumes the same input gesture (e.g. single-finger drag).
- **Concrete Rule**: Do **not** set `_controls.enabled = false` for rect selection. Rect selection uses 1-finger/left-click; Orbit uses 2-finger/right-click — they are mutually exclusive inputs. Cancel rect selection only if a second touch arrives, then clear `_activeDragPointerId` so OrbitControls can take over the two-finger gesture. Only `_objDragging` and `_sketch.drawing` legitimately need `_controls.enabled = false`.

---

## 3. UI & Layout Adaptability

### Mobile Toolbar Stability

- **Principle**: Mobile UI elements must maintain consistent layout dimensions and button placements to prevent misclicks caused by layout shifts during state changes.
- **Concrete Rule**: Each mode shows a fixed number of slots. Object mode uses **5 slots** (widest); Edit 3D uses **4 slots**. Within a mode, use `disabled: true` for temporarily unavailable actions. Pad with `{ spacer: true }` invisible placeholders so the slot count stays constant and the toolbar width never changes.

| Mode | Slot 1 | Slot 2 | Slot 3 | Slot 4 | Slot 5 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Object | Add | Dup | Edit | Delete | Stack |
| Edit 2D sketch | ← Object | Extrude | *(spacer)* | *(spacer)* | — |
| Edit 2D extrude | Confirm | Cancel | *(spacer)* | *(spacer)* | — |
| Edit 3D | ← Object | Vertex | Edge | Face | — |
| Grab active | Confirm | Stack | Cancel | *(spacer)* | — |

`{ spacer: true }` renders as a `visibility: hidden` div of identical dimensions. It occupies layout space without being tappable.

Dup, Edit, and Stack are disabled for `ImportedMesh`, `MeasureLine`, and `CoordinateFrame`. Dup is additionally disabled for `Profile`. Delete remains enabled for all object types. All Object-mode slots maintain consistent disabled states so slot positions never shift.

The Object-mode Stack button pre-sets `_grab.stackMode` before a grab gesture. `_startGrab()` does not reset `stackMode`, so the pre-set is respected. `_confirmGrab()` and `_cancelGrab()` reset it to `false` when the grab ends.

Face extrude on mobile is a gesture-only operation (tap face → drag → release = confirm). No Extrude button is shown in Edit 3D.

### Mobile Touch Gesture Model (2026-03-28)

- **Principle**: On mobile, the primary navigation gesture (one-finger drag) must always orbit the camera. Intercepting it for object dragging makes navigation unreliable and forces two-step flows to do basic panning.
- **Concrete Rule**: Touch (`e.pointerType === 'touch'`) in Object mode:
  - **Quick tap on object** → selection (unchanged).
  - **One-finger drag anywhere** → orbit via OrbitControls (no `_objDragging`, no rect selection).
  - **Long press ≥ 400 ms, < 8 px movement on a *selected* object** → `_startGrab()`. Timer stored in `_longPress.{ timer, pointerId, startX, startY }`. Cancelled in `_onPointerMove` (threshold exceeded) or `_onPointerUp` (quick release).
  - **Touch on empty space** → orbit (no rect selection started).
  - Rect selection and `_objDragging` are mouse-only paths.

```js
// _longPress timer pattern (Object mode, touch hit):
if (e.pointerType === 'touch') {
  if (this._objSelected && this._selectedIds.has(obj.id)) {
    this._longPress.timer = setTimeout(() => { this._startGrab() }, 400)
  }
  return  // no drag setup
}
```

### Measure Point Placement (Mobile: Hold-to-Snap, Release-to-Confirm)

- **Principle**: On touch devices, placement of a single point requires the user to see snap feedback before committing. A tap-and-release offers no time to adjust; hold-and-release does.
- **Concrete Rule**: Measure point confirmation happens in `_onPointerUp`, not `_onPointerDown`. On `pointerdown`, set `_measure.pressing = true` and `_activeDragPointerId`. On `pointerup`, if `_measure.pressing && _activeDragPointerId === e.pointerId`, call `_confirmMeasurePoint()`. During the hold, `_onPointerMove` continues updating snap candidates so the user sees live snap feedback. `_cancelMeasure()` also resets `pressing = false`.

### Stack Mode (Grab)

- **Principle**: When stacking objects, the Z position should be determined by what is physically below the grabbed object, not by cursor height.
- **Concrete Rule**: Stack mode is toggled with **S** during grab (or the Stack toolbar button on mobile). When active, `_applyStackSnap()` runs after the normal movement each frame — both during `_grab.active` (G-key path) **and** during `_objDragging` (touch-drag path). It casts downward rays (`(0,0,-1)`) from **Z=10000** (not from the object's current bottom) from the 4 bottom-face corners + centroid, and finds the highest surface among non-grabbed objects. `zOffset = highestHitZ - gZMin`; if `|zOffset| >= 0.001`, all selected objects' vertex Z is shifted by `zOffset` so the bottom face rests exactly on that surface. The `_grab.stacking` flag tracks whether a snap surface was found this frame.
- **Why ray origin must be HIGH_Z**: casting from `gZMin + ε` misses surfaces whose top face is *above* the grabbed object's current bottom (e.g. target is taller than where we're dragging from). Starting from Z=10000 ensures the ray finds the topmost surface at (x,y) regardless of current object height.
- **Why _objDragging path**: on desktop, mouse-dragging an object uses `_objDragging`, not `_grab.active`. Stack snap must be called in both paths. Note: touch no longer uses `_objDragging` (2026-03-28 — single-finger touch orbits; Grab via long-press uses `_grab.active`). The `_objDragging` path therefore only fires on desktop mouse drag.

### Viewport-Aware Z-Index and Positioning

- **Principle**: Floating UI elements must dynamically adjust their spatial positioning to avoid colliding with or being hidden behind device-specific layouts (like mobile toolbars).
- **Concrete Rule**: The mobile floating toolbar's top edge is at **86px** from the bottom (`bottom: 26px` + `height: 60px`). `showToast()` must check `_isMobile()` and set `bottom: 96px` (instead of the desktop `64px`) so it appears above the toolbar. If the toolbar height or position changes, update both the toolbar CSS and this constant together.

```js
const bottomPx = this._isMobile() ? '96px' : '64px'
```

On mobile, status text is shown in the footer info bar (`_infoEl`) instead of the header or canvas pill, because the mobile header is too narrow and keyboard hints are irrelevant on touch. `setStatus()` and `setStatusRich()` update `_infoEl` on mobile; `_setInfoText()` is a no-op on mobile. The `_canvasStatusEl` pill is always hidden (the footer replaces it on mobile; the header status replaces it on desktop). The Nodes button (`_nodeEditorBtn`) is desktop-only and hidden on mobile. The N-panel toggle button (`_nToggleBtn`) uses `marginLeft: auto` on mobile to stay right-aligned in the header.

## 3.5 Server-Side Async (Node.js BFF)

### All DB calls must be awaited

- **Principle**: Async DB operations that are called without `await` silently return a Promise, not the data. The caller then operates on a Promise object, causing crashes (JSON.parse of an object) or silent data loss.
- **Concrete Rule**: Every call to `sceneStore.getScene()`, `sceneStore.updateScene()`, `sceneStore.createScene()`, and `sceneStore.deleteScene()` **must** be `await`ed. Functions that call these must themselves be declared `async`. Fire-and-forget wrappers (like `_autosave`) must be `async` and must wrap all `await` calls in `try/catch` so that the caller's promise chain is never rejected unexpectedly.

```js
// WRONG — row is a Promise object, not scene data
const row = getScene(sceneId)
JSON.parse(row.data)  // throws — row.data is undefined

// CORRECT
const row = await getScene(sceneId)
```

### PRAGMA journal_mode Must Not Run Inside a Transaction

- **Principle**: `@libsql/client`'s `db.batch()` wraps all statements in a transaction. SQLite forbids switching journal mode (`PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`) from within a transaction, so including the PRAGMA in `batch()` causes a `LibsqlBatchError` at startup.
- **Concrete Rule**: Always `await db.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL')` as a standalone call *before* any `db.batch()`. Schema-creation DDL (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) is safe inside `batch()`.

```js
// WRONG — throws LibsqlBatchError on startup
await db.batch(['PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL', 'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...'], 'write')

// CORRECT
await db.execute('PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL')
await db.batch(['CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...'], 'write')
```

### Unguarded JSON.parse in DB layer

- **Principle**: A single malformed row in the database causes an unhandled rejection that crashes the current WebSocket handler or request — with no error returned to the client.
- **Concrete Rule**: Any `JSON.parse(row.data)` call in `sceneStore.js` must be wrapped in `try/catch` and re-throw a structured error so callers receive a meaningful error object instead of a generic `SyntaxError`.

### occt-import-js Geometry Structure

- **Principle**: `mesh.faces` in the occt-import-js result is **face-group metadata** (index ranges + per-face colour), not per-face geometry buffers. Accessing `face.position?.array` on these entries always returns `undefined`, silently producing zero vertices while the mesh count appears non-zero.
- **Concrete Rule**: Extract geometry at the **mesh level**, not the face level:
  ```js
  const pos = mesh.attributes?.position?.array ?? []  // Float32Array
  const nrm = mesh.attributes?.normal?.array   ?? []  // Float32Array
  const idx = mesh.index?.array                ?? []  // Uint32Array
  ```
  Use `mesh.faces` only for per-face colour/material lookups. Never use `push(...typedArray)` for large arrays — iterate with a `for` loop to avoid "Maximum call stack size exceeded".

### Camera Far Clip and Fit for Imported Geometry

- **Principle**: The default camera `far = 100` is sized for hand-built voxel scenes. STEP files from real CAD tools routinely have bounding sphere radii in the hundreds or thousands of units (mm-scale parts). Geometry beyond `far` is clipped and invisible with no error.
- **Concrete Rule**: After any `updateGeometryBuffers` call for an `ImportedMesh`, call `SceneView.fitCameraToSphere(sphere.center, sphere.radius)` to reposition the camera and dynamically expand `camera.far` to `max(current far, dist×2 + radius×4)`. The trigger is the `geometryApplied` event emitted by `SceneService`. Never hard-code `camera.far` — let `fitCameraToSphere` expand it on demand.

## 4. Memory Management (Three.js)

### WsChannel Native Event Listener Cleanup

- **Principle**: Native `WebSocket.addEventListener` callbacks are not automatically removed when the socket is closed, so re-opening a channel without removing old listeners causes two handlers to fire for every server message.
- **Concrete Rule**: In `WsChannel._connect()`, save each bound handler as an instance property (`_onWsOpen`, `_onWsMessage`, `_onWsClose`, `_onWsError`). In `close()`, call `this._ws.removeEventListener(...)` for all four before calling `this._ws.close()`. Set `this._ws = null` after closing.

### Read-Only Entity Early-Return Must Show Feedback

- **Principle**: When an operation is silently blocked for a read-only entity type (`ImportedMesh`), the user sees no indication that the shortcut was consumed. This breaks the "shortcut → visible effect" contract.
- **Concrete Rule**: Any early-return that blocks `setMode('edit')` or `_startGrab()` for `ImportedMesh` must call `this._uiView.showToast('Imported geometry is read-only')` before returning. The Tab key handler must additionally guard `e.preventDefault()` so the browser's own Tab behavior is not suppressed when no mode transition occurs.

### Object Lifecycle Symmetry

- **Principle**: Every dynamic memory allocation or scene addition must have a strictly enforced, symmetrical teardown in its disposal method to prevent memory leaks and ghost objects.
- **Concrete Rule**: In `MeshView`, every `scene.add()` or `new THREE.BufferGeometry()` in the constructor MUST have a matching `scene.remove()` and `.dispose()` in `dispose()`. Missing this breaks `SceneService.deleteObject()` — if `dispose()` throws (e.g. accessing a renamed property that is now `undefined`), `removeObject()` and `emit('objectRemoved')` never run, leaving the object in the model (outliner intact, snap candidates still active) while only the main mesh is visually removed. Whenever you add a new Three.js object in the constructor, add the teardown in the same commit.

### _clearScene Must Emit objectRemoved Before Swapping Model

- **Principle**: Replacing `this._model` in `_clearScene()` without emitting `objectRemoved` for each object causes an invisible split-brain state: the new model is empty, but the OutlinerView retains stale DOM rows and `AppController._activeObj` may hold references to disposed objects.
- **Concrete Rule**: `_clearScene()` must iterate `this._model.objects` **before** the swap, call `obj.meshView.dispose(threeScene)` and `this.emit('objectRemoved', id)` for every entry, then clear `_worldPoseCache`, and only then replace `this._model = new SceneModel()`. Failure to emit causes the Outliner to show deleted objects after a scene load (the "default Cube stays visible" bug).

```js
// CORRECT
_clearScene() {
  for (const [id, obj] of this._model.objects) {
    obj.meshView.dispose(this._threeScene)
    this.emit('objectRemoved', id)
  }
  this._worldPoseCache.clear()
  this._model = new SceneModel()
}
```

### SceneSerializer Must Handle Every Entity Type Explicitly

- **Principle**: Silently skipping an entity type in `serializeScene()` causes that type to disappear on the next load with no error. This is a silent data-loss bug — the save succeeds, the load succeeds, but objects are gone.
- **Concrete Rule**: Every domain entity class added to `SceneModel` (e.g. `Solid`, `Profile`, `MeasureLine`, `CoordinateFrame`, `ImportedMesh`) must be explicitly handled in `serializeScene()` — either serialized with a matching `_deserializeEntities` branch, or skipped with a comment explaining why (e.g. `// ImportedMesh: geometry must be re-imported`). Verify that new entity types are covered in SceneSerializer in the same commit they are added to the domain layer.
