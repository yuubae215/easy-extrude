# Roadmap

## Design Direction (2026-03-20)

This project is a **voxel-based modeling application**. All shapes are axis-aligned boxes on an integer grid. See `docs/adr/` for detailed design decisions.

## Backlog

| Priority | Item | Complexity | ADR / Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 🔴 High | Voxel shape model (`VoxelShape`, `computeExposedFaces`, `buildGeometryFromVoxels`) | Medium | ADR-001 |
| 🔴 High | Method A: Primitive Box (Shift+A → Add Box) | Low | ADR-002 |
| 🔴 High | Method B: Sketch → Extrude (2D cell paint → 3D voxel) | Medium | ADR-002 |
| 🔴 High | Orbit control → middle-click | Low | ADR-003 |
| 🔴 High | Edit Mode adapts to object type (2D/3D dispatch) | Medium | ADR-004 |
| 🟡 Medium | Object hierarchy + Outliner tree view | Medium | ADR-005 |
| 🟡 Medium | Right-click context menu (currently: cancel only) | Low | ADR-006 |
| 🟡 Medium | Multi-face extrude (Shift+click) | Medium | — |
| 🟡 Medium | Export (OBJ / GLTF) | Low | — |
| 🟢 Low | Mobile / touch support | Medium | See below |
| 🟢 Low | 1D objects: MeasureLine, reference line | Medium | ADR-005 |

## Mobile Support (Backlog · Low Priority)

**Goal:** Allow voxel editing and scene navigation on smartphones and tablets.

### Challenge: no middle mouse button on touch

The desktop scheme uses middle-drag for orbit (ADR-003). Touch devices have no middle button.

### Proposed touch mapping

| Gesture | Action |
|---------|--------|
| 1-finger drag | Edit action (paint cells / extrude face) |
| 2-finger drag | Orbit camera |
| Pinch | Zoom |
| Long-press | Context menu (replaces right-click) |
| Tap | Select / confirm |

OrbitControls already handles 2-finger orbit and pinch-to-zoom natively. The main work is routing single-finger drag to edit actions while letting 2-finger gestures pass through to OrbitControls.

### Implementation notes

- Replace `mousedown/mousemove/mouseup` with **Pointer Events API** (`pointerdown`, `pointermove`, `pointerup`) — unifies mouse, touch, stylus
- Track `_activeDragPointerId`; ignore secondary pointers during an edit drag
- Suppress browser context menu on long-press: `contextmenu` → `e.preventDefault()`
- Add `touch-action: none` CSS on canvas
- Ensure all UI tap targets ≥ 44×44 px
- Verify `renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio)` for HiDPI screens

### Key risks

- Long-press context menu conflicts with hold-to-drag on some Android browsers
- Alt+left-drag (orbit fallback for trackpad users) may be worth adding simultaneously
