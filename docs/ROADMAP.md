# Roadmap

## Design Direction (2026-03-20)

This project is a **cuboid-based modeling application**. Each shape is a deformable box defined by 8 corner vertices. Complex scenes are built by placing and deforming multiple cuboid objects. See `docs/adr/` for detailed design decisions.

## BFF + Microservices Migration (ADR-015)

The architecture evolves incrementally from a browser-only SPA toward a thin-client frontend
backed by a BFF and dedicated microservices.

**Phase B ends with a UX validation checkpoint.**
Phases C and D are intentionally left open — the direction will be decided based on learnings
from that checkpoint (pivot if needed).

```
Browser (View + Controller)
        │ REST / WebSocket
        ▼
BFF (Node.js) — auth, aggregation, routing
   ├── Scene Service   — scene CRUD + DB
   ├── User Service    — auth / profile
   └── Geometry Service — graph eval, STEP import, export
```

### Phase A — BFF skeleton + Scene persistence *(next)*

| Task | Details | ADR |
|------|---------|-----|
| Scaffold BFF (Node.js / Express or Fastify) | JWT gateway, REST routing stub | ADR-015 |
| Scene save / load REST endpoints | `POST /scenes`, `GET /scenes/:id` | ADR-015 |
| Scene Service + DB schema | Store scene JSON (objects + transform graph) | ADR-015, ADR-016 |
| TransformGraph persistence | Adjacency list: `TransformNode[]` + `TransformEdge[]`; ROS frame + quaternions | ADR-016 |
| `SceneService` → HTTP client | Replace in-memory CRUD with BFF REST calls | ADR-015 |
| Existing frontend behaviour unchanged | Client-complete fallback while BFF is wired up | ADR-015 |

### Phase B — Geometry Service + WebSocket + Node Editor prototype ★ UX checkpoint

| Task | Details | ADR |
|------|---------|-----|
| Extract Geometry Service | Geometry graph evaluation migrated server-side | ADR-015 |
| WebSocket session (BFF ↔ Frontend) | Operation-based messages (`graph.node.connect`, `geometry.update`) | ADR-015 |
| Delta-sync protocol on reconnect | Session vs persistence policy; patch vs full-state messages | ADR-016 (open) |
| Node Editor UI prototype | Visual DAG editing; nodes stream geometry results via WebSocket | ADR-016 |
| STEP import prototype | `occt-import-js` in Geometry Service; file upload REST + WebSocket progress | ADR-015 |
| TransformGraph → DAG | Add OperationNodes (cycle detection policy) | ADR-016 |
| **★ UX validation checkpoint** | Evaluate: latency feel, Node Editor usability, STEP import UX. Decide pivot direction for Phase C+. | — |

### Phase C+ — Post-validation (direction TBD after Phase B checkpoint)

> **Decide after Phase B UX validation.** Possible directions:
>
> - **Continue as planned** — STEP import production, frontend entity shrink, fully thin client (original Phase C/D)
> - **Pivot: focus on Node Editor UX** — double down on visual graph editing; defer STEP/thin-client
> - **Pivot: simplify backend** — collapse Geometry Service back into BFF if WebSocket latency hurts UX
> - **Other** — based on user feedback from the prototype

Candidate tasks (held, not committed):

| Candidate Task | Original Phase | ADR |
|---------------|----------------|-----|
| STEP import production-ready | C | ADR-015 |
| B-rep topology → graph | C | ADR-016 (open) |
| Frontend domain entities → cache-only | C | ADR-015 |
| GLTF / OBJ export (Geometry Service) | C | ADR-015 |
| Remove all domain computation from frontend | D | ADR-015 |
| Frontend unit tests — View / Controller only | D | ADR-015 |
| Independent Geometry Service scaling | D | ADR-015 |

## Backlog (frontend features)

| Priority | Item | Complexity | ADR / Notes |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| 🟡 Medium | Object hierarchy + Outliner tree view | Medium | ADR-005 |
| 🟡 Medium | Right-click context menu (currently: cancel only) | Low | ADR-006 |
| 🟡 Medium | Multi-face extrude (Shift+click) | Medium | — |
| 🟡 Medium | Export (OBJ / GLTF) | Low | Phase C via Geometry Service |
| 🟢 Low | 1D objects: MeasureLine, reference line | Medium | ADR-005 |
| 🟢 Low | Assembly groups (virtual TransformNode pivot) | Medium | ADR-016 |
| 🟢 Low | Revolute / prismatic constraints in Node Editor | High | ADR-016 |
